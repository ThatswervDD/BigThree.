Gianluigi Buffon, Iker Casillas, and Manuel Neuer are three legendary goalkeepers who have not only transformed the position but also set new standards for what it means to be a great goalkeeper. Buffon, known for his incredible reflexes and world-class saves, has been a staple in the Italian national team and Juventus for decades. Casillas, a Spanish national team hero, was instrumental in Real Madrid's success and won numerous trophies throughout his illustrious career. Neuer, a modern goalkeeper, is known for his unique style of play, which involves coming out of his box and playing as a sweeper-keeper. He has redefined the position and has won multiple titles with Bayern Munich and the German national team. These three goalkeepers have left an indelible mark on the sport and are often the subject of debates about who is the greatest of all time.<p>
  They all had their special traits and made the game in their own beautiful way
